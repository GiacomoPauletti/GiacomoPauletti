- Hey githuber, I’m Giacomo Pauletti
- I'm interested in _Computer simulations of physical phenomena_ (what kind of phenomena is yet to be decided, every choice is amazing in this field) 
  - I’m also a bit interested in _Artificial Intelligence_, expecially Image Recognition and Image Segmentation 🖥️
- I’m partecipating in a double degree program **EUMaster4HPC**, taking my (current) first year @Polimi and the second year at @Sorbonne 👨‍🎓️
